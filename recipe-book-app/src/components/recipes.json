      "Preheat either a stovetop Taiyaki waffle iron or an electric Taiyaki maker to bake the batter.",
      "Before pouring the batter into the fish-shaped mold, brush the surfaces with some oil to prevent sticking. Fill the waffle iron halfway with batter to leave enough space for the filling. Using a spoon, spread Anko onto the batter. Alternatively, you can use other ingredients as fillings. Pour the remaining batter into the mold until it's full.",
      "After approximately 3-4 minutes, the Taiyaki will be ready! It's best to enjoy the fish-shaped pastries while they're still warm."

Remove from the tin, leave to rest and set the tin aside until you\u2019re ready to make the gravy.",

Bubble together, then drain the veg over the roasting tin and stir in the vegetable stock. Bring the gravy to the boil, taste for seasoning, adding more Worcestershire sauce if needed, then pour into a warm gravy jug."

    "Instruction": [
      "Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Butter a 22 x 31cm or similar Swiss roll tin, then line with buttered baking paper. Tip in 1 tbsp cocoa, turn the tin until it\u2019s evenly coated, then tap out any excess.",
      "For the sponge, beat the eggs and sugar with electric beaters for 7 mins, or until thick enough to hold a trail. Fold in flour and cocoa, then swirl in butter and fold through. Tip into the tin, bake for 10 mins until just firm, then cool under a clean tea towel.",
      "For the mousse, beat the egg yolks with the sugar until thick and pale. Melt the chocolate and loosely whip the cream until it just holds its shape. Quickly beat half the cream and all of the chocolate into the egg mix, then gently fold in the rest of the cream. Whisk the egg whites until softly peaked, then fold in.",
      "Grease a 1.4 litre/2\u00bd pint basin with a little oil. Line with cling film, letting it overhang. To build the pudding, cut a circle of sponge to fit the bottom of the basin and put it in. Cut seven sloping rectangles about 10cm long from the sponge and fit them tightly together around the bowl. Sprinkle with most of the coffee and Tia Maria mix. Fill the bowl halfway with the mousse then, using what\u2019s left of the sponge, top the mousse with a snug-fitting circle of cake. Sprinkle with remaining coffee mix. Spoon in the rest of the mousse, then cover with the overhanging cling film. Chill for at least 4 hrs until firm (ideally overnight), then turn onto a plate.",
      "For the topping, heat all the ingredients gently in a bowl over a pan of simmering water until the chocolate melts. Leave to cool, stirring occasionally, until thick and glossy. Spread all over the turned-out pudding, then top with the chocolate-coated cocoa beans and chocolate curls."
