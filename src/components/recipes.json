      "Preheat either a stovetop Taiyaki waffle iron or an electric Taiyaki maker to bake the batter.",
      "Before pouring the batter into the fish-shaped mold, brush the surfaces with some oil to prevent sticking. Fill the waffle iron halfway with batter to leave enough space for the filling. Using a spoon, spread Anko onto the batter. Alternatively, you can use other ingredients as fillings. Pour the remaining batter into the mold until it's full.",
      "After approximately 3-4 minutes, the Taiyaki will be ready! It's best to enjoy the fish-shaped pastries while they're still warm."
